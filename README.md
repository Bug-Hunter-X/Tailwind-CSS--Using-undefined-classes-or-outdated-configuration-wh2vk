# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bug: Using Undefined Classes or Outdated Configuration

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where classes are used that are not defined in the configuration file, or where an outdated configuration file is being used. This can lead to unexpected styling or no styling at all.

## Bug

The bug is caused by using Tailwind CSS classes that are not defined in the `tailwind.config.js` file, or using a configuration file that does not match the version of Tailwind CSS being used.  This typically results in no styling being applied to the elements using these undefined classes.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that the `tailwind.config.js` file contains the correct configuration for the classes being used. This may involve adding new classes, updating the configuration to match the current version of Tailwind, or double-checking that the classes are spelled correctly.

Additionally, make sure to run `npm run build` (or the equivalent command for your project) to rebuild the CSS file after changes are made to the `tailwind.config.js` file.
